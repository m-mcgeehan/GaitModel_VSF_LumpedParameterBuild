# GaitModel_VSF_LumpedParameterBuild
 Simulation-capable gait model built in Simscape Multibody and parameterized through MATLAB API
 
Required software: MATLAB and Simulink. Note, this model was built in MATLAB 2019b. Follow the MATLAB prompts to re-build the model in an alternative version.

Initialization procedure:

Run "Startup_GaitModel_VSF_2_24_20.m" ({GitHub Directory}/GaitModel_VSF_LumpedParameterBuild/matlab scripts/VSF Gait Model v3/Startup_GaitModel_VSF_2_24_20.m. This script will add file dependencies, scale and build the model, and load model controls.
